Ready-to-import solutions for custom font control

demo_1_1_managed.zip

This file is the demo only, including the necessary font-loader PCF and an app to showcase how fonts can be selected at RUNTIME.  This is not a "clean" control.  That is, it includes parameter selection in the contol so you can't use it as a replacement for your TEXT or LABEL controls.

external_font_control_1_1_managed.zip

This file is a "clean" PCF control that you can use as a replacement for your TEXT or LABEL controls in the maker portal whenever you need a custom/external font.  All configuration is done through parameters in the maker portal.

external_font_control_1_1_unmanaged.zip

This file is the same as the managed version above, but is open for further tinkering in case you want to extend it's capabilities.

CustomFonts_1_0_0_1.zip

This is all of the above, wrapped into one package

If all you need is the font-loader module itself, without any demo content or plug-and-play control, just download "font-loader.ts" from the font-loader directory.  See the README in that directory for more information.
